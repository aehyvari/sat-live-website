Call For Participants in the competition

The 1st Combinatorial Reconfiguration Challenge 
(CoRe Challenge 2022)

https://core-challenge.github.io/2022/

Submission deadline: March 31st 2022
====================================================================

** Overview **

Combinatorial Reconfiguration is a novel algorithmic concept that provides mathematical models and analysis for "transformations over state spaces." Its appearance ranges from theory to applications. However, its technical achievements are hard to access. Thus, it is required to found a common infrastructure for utilizing and applying the algorithmic technology of combinatorial reconfiguration. 
See this website (https://core.dais.is.tohoku.ac.jp/en/project/project_summary/) for more backgrounds.

The 1st Combinatorial Reconfiguration Challenge (CoRe Challenge 2022) is a competition aiming for practically exploring the combinatorial reconfiguration.

This 1st challenge targets the Independent Set Reconfiguration (ISR) problem.
The ISR problem is one of the most well-studied reconfiguration problems. Theoretically, the problem is PSPACE-complete, which implies that there exist instances such that even a shortest reconfiguration sequence requires a super polynomial steps. Theoretical results and their references can be found in a survey by N. Nishimura (https://doi.org/10.3390/a11040052).
